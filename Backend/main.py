The Edmonton zone has 22 per cent of cases, the second-most in the province. More than 42,500 Albertans have now been tested for COVID-19, meaning nearly one in every 100 Albertans have received a test. About 1.5 per cent of those tests have come back positive. Rates of testing in Alberta jolted back up on Friday, with more than 3,600 conducted — the most yet in a single day. The surge followed one of Alberta’s lowest testing days Thursday, as the province shifted its testing focus away from returning travellers and towards health-care workers and vulnerable populations, including those in hospital or living in continuing care facilities."
